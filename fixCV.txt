1. Inconsistent Formatting of Work Experience
Mistake: The formatting of job titles and responsibilities is inconsistent. For example, "JUNIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER" appears twice, and some sections are written in a paragraph style, while others use bullet points. This could confuse the reader.

Fix: Use consistent formatting for job titles and bullet points to ensure clarity and readability.


2. Unclear Job Description & Achievements
Mistake: Some job responsibilities and achievements are vague or incomplete. For example, "Boosted team efficiency by a high rate" doesnâ€™t specify the actual percentage or impact of the improvement.

Fix: Quantify the achievements and be more specific about the impact.

3. Overuse of the Same Phrase (Repetition)
Mistake: The phrase "Heiman Software Labs, a global company that provides software services across various industries" is repeated multiple times. This redundancy can be avoided.

Fix: Eliminate repetition and streamline the description of the company.

4. Missing Time Consistency in Dates
Mistake: The "Intern" position is listed as "Oct 2021 to Dec 2021 (3 months)," but it would be better to match the format and make sure it's clear and consistent with the rest of the dates in the resume. Also, the "Junior Software Engineer" experience dates are slightly inconsistent in terms of formatting.

Fix: Ensure that all date formats are consistent throughout the resume.

5. Skills Section Needs Better Organization
Mistake: The "RELEVANT SKILLS" section lists languages, but it could be more organized to emphasize proficiency levels or specific tools.

Fix: Organize the skills into categories, like programming languages, frameworks, and tools, and add a proficiency level if relevant.
